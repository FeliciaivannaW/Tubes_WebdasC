        <h3>Did you know? Food names change depending on where you are in the UK</h3>
        <p>A curious thing about food in Britain is that the names of certain edibles change depending on where you are in the UK. Bread rolls, for example, might be called buns, cobs, baps, or barm cakes. Although sandwiches are common enough, you can hear people asking for butties, banjos, sarnies, and sammies.</p>

        <h2>English 
            <br><span class="highlight">Eating Habits.</span>
        </h2>
        <p>People in England typically eat three main meals a day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Breakfast can be light (like cereal or toast) or hearty, such as a full English breakfast. Lunch is usually a light meal, often sandwiches or salads. Dinner (also called “tea” in some regions) is the main meal and is eaten in the evening. Many people enjoy snacks between meals and traditional customs like afternoon tea, which includes tea with biscuits, scones, or small cakes.</p>
